## Advanced Examples

### Trip Cost Calculator
```
# Trip Budget
flight = $450
hotel = $120
days = 5
total_hotel = hotel * days
meals = $50
total_meals = meals * days
total = flight + total_hotel + total_meals
```

### Room Painter
```
# Paint Calculator
wall_length = 12 feet
wall_height = 8 feet
wall_area = wall_length * wall_height
coverage = 350 sqft
gallons = wall_area / coverage
```

### Recipe Scaler
```
# Recipe (Original serves 4)
original_servings = 4
new_servings = 8
scale = new_servings / original_servings

flour = 2 cups
scaled_flour = flour * scale

sugar = 1 cup
scaled_sugar = sugar * scale
```

### Investment Calculator
```
# Investment Return
principal = $10000
rate = 7%
years = 10
annual_return = principal * rate
total_simple = principal + (annual_return * years)
```

### Unit Price Comparison
```
# Which is cheaper?
pack_a_price = $12
pack_a_count = 24
pack_a_unit = pack_a_price / pack_a_count

pack_b_price = $8
pack_b_count = 15
pack_b_unit = pack_b_price / pack_b_count
```

### Fuel Efficiency
```
# Gas Mileage
miles_driven = 350 miles
gallons_used = 12 gallons
mpg = miles_driven / gallons_used

// Convert to metric
km_driven = miles_driven in km
liters_used = gallons_used in liters
kpl = km_driven / liters_used
```

## Tips & Tricks

1. **Headers** - Organize your calculations
```
# My Budget
# Travel Expenses
# Total Cost
```

2. **Comments** - Add notes
```
// This is the price before tax
// Remember to update this monthly
```

3. **Reference Previous** - Use `prev`
```
100 + 50
prev * 2
prev - 25
```

4. **Chain Conversions**
```
20 inches in cm + 5 cm
100 USD in EUR - 10 EUR
```

5. **Complex Expressions**
```
(100 + 50) * 0.8 - 20
sqrt(16) + 2^3
pi * 5^2
```
